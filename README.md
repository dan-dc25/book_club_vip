Book Club Vip is an application developed to help readers search for books, browse, save to personal collection, create notes related to the books they have read or the books in their favorite list they are going to read. 
The application was developed using a Rails API backend and React and Redux to handle all of the client-side interactions. Thunk middleware is used to handle asynchronous fetch and dispatch requests. 
I used Google Books API to seed data into the application. They have an immense collection of books to browse and it was crucial on the development of this application. The
